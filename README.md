# djangoTutorialSeries
Here are a series of django exercises and tutorials I did for practice
<ol>
  <li><a href="#second">Second/Third project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fourth">Fourth project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fifth">Fifth project</a></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="second">Second Project</a></h3>
<p> This project continues working with url mappings and models but also it connects such models to django forms
<h3><a name="fourth">Fourth Project</a></h3>
<p> This project uses template inheritance to avoid repeating code and uses filters as a mean to manipulate the data given in the views context
<h3><a name="fifth">Fifth Project</a></h3>
<p>This project uses authentication with bcrypt and argon2 and controls views with login required.<br/>
This can be seen on <a href="http://foxtreme.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere</a></p>
